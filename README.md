# Priorty Scheduling Simulation

The Priority Scheduling Simulation is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python's Tkinter library. The program simulates the priority scheduling algorithm, which is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm in operating systems. Each process is assigned a priority, and the process with the highest priority is selected first for execution. The application allows users to add processes, specify their burst time and priority, and simulate the execution of these processes based on their priorities.
